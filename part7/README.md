## Part 7

#### Anecdotes exercises

These are all in the **notes-app-frontend** folder. I took the anecdotes app idea 
and made a new notes app for this part, to get more practice with building the
backend and frontend from the beginning.

#### Countries exercise & Ultimate Hooks

These are each in their respective folders.

#### Bloglist App

This app is still under the part 5 folder, here is the link: https://github.com/astridlyre/full-stack-open/tree/master/part5/bloglist-ui
I completed all the exercises. You can view the live version here: https://linkr-list.herokuapp.com/
