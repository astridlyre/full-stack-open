## Countries

#### 2.12 Data for countries

Interacted with REST Countries API.

#### 2.13

Added a button to let you view individual countries. It handles all edge cases with view button, or with typing exact country name.

#### 2.14

Added weather for each country capital, using Weatherstack API. I used an env variable to save the API key.
