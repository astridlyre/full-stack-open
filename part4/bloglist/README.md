## Blog List Exercise

#### 4.1 - 4.2

Built blog list application that allows users to save information about interesting blogs. Each entry contains Title, Author, URL and number of Likes. The application is organized into separate modules.

#### 4.3

Set up initial test with a dummy function. It worked!

#### 4.4 - 4.7

Added some helper tests. I didn't use Lodash for the last two exercises.
