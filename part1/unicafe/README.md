## Unicafe Project

#### 1.6 Unicafe Step 1

I spruced it up a little bit with some CSS and I made the background img change depending on which amount of reviews is highest.

#### 1.7 Unicafe Step 2

Added total, average & positive statistics. Formatted the results a bit to make them look nicer.

#### 1.8 & 1.9 Unicafe Steps 3 & 4

I did these two steps together.

#### 1.10 & 1.11 Unicafe Steps 5 & 6

I had already extracted the button component, but now I have extracted the statistic component. Instead of formatting with a table, I have kept it formatted with CSS Grid istead. I think this look is fine.
